# Open Source Tools for Threat Intelligence, Vulnerability Management, and Forensics

As someone working in cybersecurity, I know firsthand the importance of having effective tools for threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and forensics. Fortunately, there are several open source options available that can help organizations address these challenges.

## Threat Intelligence:

| :-------------- |:---------------------------------------------------| :------------------------------------|
| Threat Stream    | This platform aggregates and analyzes threat data from multiple sources, providing real-time visibility into emerging threats | link|||
| TheHive     | This incident response platform integrates with a variety of threat intelligence feeds to help security teams quickly identify and respond to threats. | link|||
| MISP | MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open source platform for sharing, storing, and collaborating on threat intelligence. It is designed to facilitate the exchange of information about cybersecurity threats, including malware, phishing attacks, and other types of cybercrime.|Link|||


## Vulnerability Management:

| OpenVAS    | This vulnerability assessment tool allows organizations to scan their systems for known vulnerabilities and apply patches to mitigate risks.
 | Shoadan|I often use Shodan to help me identify and understand internet-connected devices and systems. Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices, including servers, routers, cameras, and industrial control systems. It allows you to search for devices using keywords, IP addresses, and other criteria, and provides detailed information about each device, including its IP address, operating system, and open ports||
| Nmap | As a cybersecurity professional, I frequently use Nmap (Network Mapper) for network scanning and discovery. Nmap is an open source tool that can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It works by sending specialized packets to a target system and analyzing the responses to determine the network configuration and open ports. Nmap has a command-line interface as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) called Zenmap, which provides a more user-friendly interface for running scans and analyzing results. It is an essential tool for tasks such as network inventory, identifying open ports on a system, and detecting security vulnerabilities.| |||
| Nessus Essentials:| This popular vulnerability scanner offers a range of features, including patch management and compliance reporting.||||

## Forensics:

Autopsy: This open source digital forensics platform provides a range of tools for analyzing and recovering data from digital devices.

Sleuth Kit: This suite of tools allows forensic analysts to extract and analyze data from a variety of sources, including disk images and live systems.

By leveraging these open source tools, you can improve your threat intelligence capabilities, identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and effectively conduct forensic investigations when needed.
